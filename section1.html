                        <p>Satoru Iwata had always been a naturally curious 
                            and intelligent person, as well as a natural leader. 
                            In his spare time, he would read encyclopedias cover-to-cover. 
                            Throughout his school years, Iwata served as class president, 
                            student council president, and club president, early signs of his leadership 
                            ability.

                    However, his first experience with computers and video games was back when he was in middle school. 
                    Often taking the Sapporo subway for transport, Iwata would spend his time at the pay-per-hour computers 
                    installed there, playing a game called “Game 31”. This experience sparked his interest in video games and computers.

                        Later, in his junior year of high school, Iwata began creating his first games. On a programmable calculator!

                    <p>
                        He was so fascinated by this calculator that he worked part-time as a dishwasher to save up the money to purchase 
                        it (his father also paid a portion of the price). One of the first games he made was a baseball game (entirely numerical). 
                        After seeing his friend's excitement upon playing the game, Iwata felt proud and found that it was a source of “energy and passion” 
                        for himself, thus cementing his life's course.

                        The HP 65 was a programmable calculator released by Hewlett-Packard in 1974. The calculator had a memory for up to 100 instructions. 
                        To write a program, you would insert a magnetic card into the calculator and record each key press as a step in the program. This program 
                        could then be run by sliding the magnetic card through the calculator. At the time, the calculator was priced at $750($5,069 today!!).

                    In 1978, Iwata started to attend the Tokyo Institute of Technology, majoring in computer science and engineering (had video game design been available 
                    then, it would have been his first choice). However, this education didn’t challenge him, as he had already spent a significant amount of time learning 
                    about computers in high school. Using the money he was gifted for graduating high school, Iwata purchased his very first computer: a Commodore PET 2001. 
                    He spent a lot of his time disassembling and reassembling his computer to learn as much about it as possible (he would later discover that the CPU used in 
                    his computer was similar to the one used in Nintendo’s N.E.S.).

                <p>
                    While working as an intern at Commodore Tokyo, Iwata programmed and released his first game called Car Race.

                    Wishing to share his passion, creations, and knowledge, as well as learn more about games himself, Iwata began to frequent the computer store at the Seibu Department 
                    store in Ikebukuro. There, he met and became fast friends with others who were just as passionate about games as he was. They would also befriend the manager of the store, 
                    who would later start his own game company with them, known as HAL Laboratory. Thus, this position marked the start of Iwata’s programming career.
