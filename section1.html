                        <p>Satoru Iwata had always been a naturally curious 
                            and intelligent person, as well as a natural leader. 
                            In his spare time, he would read encyclopedias cover-to-cover. 
                            Throughout his school years, Iwata served as class president, 
                            student council president, and club president, early signs of his leadership 
                            ability.

                    However, his first experience with computers and video games was back when he was in middle school. 
                    Often taking the Sapporo subway for transport, Iwata would spend his time at the pay-per-hour computers 
                    installed there, playing a game called “Game 31”. This experience sparked his interest in video games and computers.

                        Later, in his junior year of high school, Iwata began creating his first games. On a programmable calculator!

                        He was so fascinated by this calculator that he worked part-time as a dishwasher to save up the money to purchase 
                        it (his father also paid a portion of the price). One of the first games he made was a baseball game (entirely numerical). 
                        After seeing his friend's excitement upon playing the game, Iwata felt proud and found that it was a source of “energy and passion” 
                        for himself, thus cementing his life's course.

                        The HP 65 was a programmable calculator released by Hewlett-Packard in 1974. The calculator had a memory for up to 100 instructions. 
                        To write a program, you would insert a magnetic card into the calculator and record each key press as a step in the program. This program 
                        could then be run by sliding the magnetic card through the calculator. At the time, the calculator was priced at $750($5,069 today!!).
